#### _By Sara Hamilton_

## Description
_This is the Epicodus weekly project for week 1 of the JavaScript course. Its purpose is to demonstrate understanding of npm, and testing with Karma and Jasmine._

#### _Super Galactic Age Calculator_
* Takes in a person's age in Earth years and outputs their age in Mercury years, Venus years, Mars years, and Jupiter years.  It also calculates a person's age in relation to life expectancy.  It outputs a person's life expectancy adjusted to the year length for each planet and how much longer in each planet's years until they reach the average life expectancy or how far they have lived passed the average life expectancy.  

### Specifications

  * sample input: 30

* Take in a person's age and return the age in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
  * sample input: 30
  * sample output: 2
* Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet based on life expectancy.
  * sample input: Earth age: 30, life expectancy: 80 years
  * sample output: Mercury: 204 years, Venus: 79 years, Mars: 26 years, Jupiter: 4 years
* If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy.
  * sample input: Earth age: 90, life expectancy: 80 years
  * sample output: Mercury: 42 years, Venus: 16 years, Mars: 5 years, Jupiter: <1 year
